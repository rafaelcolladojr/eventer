## Inspiration

This application's interface was completely borrowed from [a design](https://dribbble.com/shots/15718338-Task-Management-App-Project-Management) by [Andri.](https://dribbble.com/andri145) of [Picko Lab](https://dribbble.com/Pickolab) on dribbble. All credit for the graphic design used in this project goes to him. Feel free to check out his other works.

<!-- The illustration used in the welcome screen was designed by [Cami](https://dribbble.com/camidobrin). -->

## Fork & Setup

While this project can be adapted to use any external or internal datasource, it currently uses hard-coded values presented as an internal datasource. To adapt this application to a legitmite datasource (REST API, etc), the provided datasource can be used as a template.
