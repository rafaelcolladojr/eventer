## Inspiration

This application's interface was completely borrowed from [a design](https://dribbble.com/shots/15718338-Task-Management-App-Project-Management) by [Andri.](https://dribbble.com/andri145) of [Picko Lab](https://dribbble.com/Pickolab) on dribbble. All credit for the graphic design used in this project goes to him. Feel free to check out their other works.

The illustrations used in this mock were designed by the talented [Maya Nguyen](https://dribbble.com/mayanguyen).

## Fork & Setup

While this project can be adapted to use any external or internal datasource, it currently uses hard-coded values presented as an internal datasource. To adapt this application to a legitmite datasource (REST API, etc), the provided datasource can be used as a template.
